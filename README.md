# Overview
`espn_webscrape` is a Python project that scrapes 2023 Team Schedule Data up to 09/29/2023. The project scrapes ESPN data so you don't have to. It retrieves all schedule data from each MLB team as well as additional data such as Run Differentials, Win/Loss Streak, and Team Logo data. This package loops through each team data and creates a temporary URL for you to access the data in downloadable `.csv` format to use for further data analysis in data visualization tools such as Tableau.
